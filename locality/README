Simon and Aiden helped answer a question about strange coloring 
with the pixels (I made sure not to show them the code)

Architecture/Overview:
The flag parcer, PNM reader, and writer are done for us in the starter code. That being said, we must implement a image mapper which will take in a Pnm_ppm, the A2_Me

Timing Table:
We used a custom ppm called bigTest.ppm, with dimensions (8192 x 8192)
