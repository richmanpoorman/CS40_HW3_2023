Help Recieved: 
Simon and Aiden helped answer a question about strange coloring 
with the pixels (I made sure not to show them the code)

Overview:
We have implemented the rotate 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees, as well as the flip
horizontal, flip vertical, transpose, and time operations in the correct way.  

Architecture:
            Image            Image         Rotated Image 
/-----------\    /-----------\    /-----------\    /-----------\
|   Flag    |---\|  Image    |---\|   Image   |---\|   Image   |______(STDOUT)     
|   Parcer  |---/|  Reader   |---/|   Mapper  |---/|   Writer  |
\-----------/    \-----------/    \-----------/    \-----------/
            Methods             

In our program we have four crucial modules, which is essentially the methods 
we used to carry out the entire functionality of this assignment. As an 
overview, we include a flag parcer, an image reader, an imageMapper, and a 
image writer. The flag parcer determines which operation that the client 
performs on an image. These operations include rotation 0, 90, 180, and 270 
degrees, among others. In other words, it helps the computer decipher which of 
the operations is called, giving the computer a way to call the right operation 
on the image. The flag parcer essentially spits out an, image, the A2Methods, 
as well as the timing file.  Adding to this, we also created an image reader 
which helps us to read the provided image from the client. This gives us a way 
to store this information in order to perform the operations listed above. 
With this information, we feed it to our imageMapper. The imageMapper takes
in an image, a A2Methods_mapfun function, the operation which is determined by 
flag parcer, as well as the timing file. In essence, imageMapper begins the 
timer, runs the operation, and ends the timer. Finally, we also write to stdout 
using the pnm_ppm, allowing the client to see the image after the operation 
that they ran. 

Timing Table:
We used a custom ppm called bigTest.ppm, with dimensions (8192 x 8192)
